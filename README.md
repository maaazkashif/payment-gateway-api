# Payment Gateway API

A lightweight and secure payment gateway built with **FastAPI**, designed to handle merchantâ€“customer transactions with reliability and scalability in mind.  

This project demonstrates secure authentication, role-based access, and ACID-compliant database transactionsâ€”making it a strong foundation for production-ready financial services.

- **Payments**
  - Customer-to-merchant transactions
  - Reliable commits with retry logic
  - ACID-compliant database operations

- **Security**
  - Password hashing
  - Token-based authentication
  - Input validation with Pydantic

## Project Structure

- **main.py** â†’ Starts the FastAPI server and includes all routes.  
- **models.py** â†’ Defines the database tables (Users, Transactions, etc.).  
- **schemas.py** â†’ Pydantic models for validating API requests and responses.  
- **auth.py** â†’ Handles authentication (JWT tokens, password hashing).  
- **database.py** â†’ Manages database connection and sessions.  
- **routes/users.py** â†’ Contains user-related endpoints (register, login).  
- **routes/transactions.py** â†’ Contains transaction-related endpoints (create, view transactions).  
- **tests/test_users.py** â†’ Tests for user registration and login functionality.  
- **tests/test_transactions.py** â†’ Tests for creating and viewing transactions.  
- **requirements.txt** â†’ Lists dependencies for the project.

ðŸ“– API Endpoints

Users :
POST /users/register â†’ Register new customer/merchant
POST /users/login â†’ Authenticate and get JWT

Transactions :
POST /transactions/ â†’ Create a payment transaction (customer â†’ merchant)
GET /transactions/ â†’ Fetch transaction history
